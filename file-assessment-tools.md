# FILE ASSESSMENT TOOLS

## OVERVIEW

Metadata assessment, audit, conformance, and creation tools are utilities created by individuals or teams with specific use cases and biases. Be aware of the context which the tool you use was created and is maintained. This will help you determine which tool is the best fit for your needs.

Common tools used in archives, museums, libraries, and other data management spaces are listed below because they do an okay to great job of handling audiovisual files and are updated or maintained on a semi-regular basis. The tools are presented in alphabetical order.

Review the [*Community Owned digital Preservation Tool Registry* (COPTR)](http://coptr.digipres.org/Main_Page) which features ~500 tools that can be used in data management.
