# FILE ASSESSMENT TOOLS

## OVERVIEW

Metadata assessment, audit, conformance, and creation tools are utilities created by individuals or teams with specific use cases and biases. Be aware of the context which the tool you use was created and is maintained. This will help you determine which tool is the best fit for your needs.

Common tools used in archives, museums, libraries, and other data management spaces are listed below because they do an okay to great job of handling audiovisual files and are updated or maintained on a semi-regular basis. The tools are presented in alphabetical order.


## TOOL LIST

Review the [*Community Owned digital Preservation Tool Registry* (COPTR)](http://coptr.digipres.org/Main_Page) which features ~500 tools that can be used in data management (check out [Tools by function](http://coptr.digipres.org/Category:Function) to explore topics like file management and metadata extraction.)

|Tool|Notes|
| ---- |------|
|[ExifTool](http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/)| A command-line application that can read, write, and edit embedded metadata in files, best for still images but with the ability to handle some A/V|
|[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)| A robust command-line application developed to manipulate A/V, with ability to write metadata in a key,value pair, transcode, and transform files. A handy quick-start guide to common FFmpeg commands is [ffmprovisr](https://amiaopensource.github.io/ffmprovisr/).|
|[FFprobe](https://ffmpeg.org/ffprobe.html)|ffprobe "gathers information from multimedia streams and prints it in human- and machine-readable fashion".|
|[MediaInfo](https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo)|MediaInfo is "a convenient unified display of the most relevant technical and tag data for video and audio files.". It also is one of the most common and referenced metadata tools for A/V material in use by those working in the archiving and preservation fields.|
|[MediaConch](mediaconch.net)|GUI and CLI options that act as "implementation checker, policy checker, & reporter for Matroska, FFV1, & PCM," among other formats.|
|[QCTools](https://github.com/bavc/qctools)|Software "that helps users analyze and understand their digitized video files through use of audiovisual analytics and filtering", and has viewing/reporting features that can be used for metadata assessment.|
|Metadata profiling modules in digital repository software|e.g. Archivematica's _Analysis_ pane, which the Bentley Historical Archive at the Univ. of Michigan describes in their [Digital Processing workflow documentation](https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/bhl-archival-curation/processing-archival-collections/08-digital-processing/step-3-appraisal)|
|Metadata modules in non-linear editors or photo editing software|e.g. Adobe Bridge's _Metadata_ pane or Final Cut Pro & Adobe Premier's metadata tabs.|
|Utilities to evaluate digital environments like removable media |A number of storage and network environment assessment tools exist, including [BitCurator](https://www.bitcurator.net/bitcurator/) which is the most highly developed open source tool with a variety of reporting features, including a bar graph of all format types, a report that shows you hidden and/or deleted files, drive partition information, and other reporting on technical metadata (h/t to [@shirapeltzman](https://github.com/shirapeltzman) for info).|
